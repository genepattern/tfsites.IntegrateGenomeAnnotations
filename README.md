# tfsites.integrateGenomeAnnotations
Checks whether overlap exists between a list of mutations in a genotypic dataset and BED files containing genomic regions of interest. For each mutation, it is reported whether or not the region of each mutation overlaps with the regions contained within each BED file.

Created in collaboration with the Emma Farley Lab (UCSD)
